# **DE Final Project: Lock Box**
# Introduction
When searching for my final project, I went through various thoughts and ideas about the project I wanted to do for the final weeks of the class. I landed on the lock box because I liked the idea of being able to design something (in this case the box) but also incorperate a digital component in the project. When learning code in class and doing activities, I used a lot of different types of components and parts using the Pi-Top such as buttons, sensors, pentiometers, etc. However, I never used any motors so it was really cool that I was able to incorperate one in my project so that I could learn how they could function as well as knowing how to program them to do what I'd like. In this project I learned not just how to code but also how to apply it.
