# **DE Final Project: Lock Box**
# Introduction
When searching for my final project, I went through various thoughts and ideas about the project I wanted to do for the final weeks of the class. I landed on the lock box because I liked the idea of being able to design something (in this case the box) but also incorperate a digital component in the project. When learning code in class and doing activities, I used a lot of different types of components and parts using the Pi-Top such as buttons, sensors, pentiometers, etc. However, I never used any motors so it was really cool that I was able to incorperate one in my project so that I could learn how they could function as well as knowing how to program them to do what I'd like. In this project I learned not just how to code but also how to apply it. 

# Step 1: Initial Design


1. First, I grabbed a whiteboard and marker to brainstorm how I wanted my box to look and function. This is where I got my initial idea on how I was going to construct my box. 

2. Using the drawing I made, I got some cardboard cut and shaped how I wanted to make my box look and how big. This helped me get the general idea of how I wanted my box to look and also how I wanted it to function. I saw that I needed to have the servo motor start at a 90 degree angle and then finish with a target angle of 0. 

3. After making my prototype, I measured all the lengths so that when I make my final design, I can know how big to make it. I based these measurements on how big it needed to be so that I could fit all my buttons, pi-top, motor, and LEDs.

# Step 2: Making the Code
When working on my code, first I wrote it like it was like a ladder. It contained if, when, else statements and looked great to me but when I tested it in the end, it didn’t work. I tested it and tried to make it work but I decided to start over when I wasn’t getting anywhere. Next, I tried a new system by using a counter where everytime you push a button correctly the counter goes up by one. I worked on this for a while but in the end it didn’t end up working either. Finally, I talked with my tablemate Lucas and he gave me a pushing start to guide me in the right direction. I kept working on it and finally got my code to work as I wanted it to. For the final tweak, I realised that I needed to have my motor start at a 90 degree angle and then change to a 0 degree angle so I switched around some numbers in my code and got my code to work perfectly. Overall, the trial and error was frustrating but I learnt a lot along the way like new ways do do different things.

# Step 3: Making the Physical Box
1. I found some wood in my garage and took out my paper with the sketch of my box and the measurements that I made previously and drew out my box on the plank. To do this I used:
- T Square
- Pencil
- Tape Measurer
- Wood Plank
